Entry for Game Off 2021

## Diary

### Day 1, 2nd November 2021 AEST
- Thought about the 'bug' theme, going through ideas like a game with programming bugs you have to fix (too big), to being a character walking through bushes to scatter bugs to be collected (seems reasonable)

### Day 2, 3rd November 2021 AEST
- Setup repo after work and started this diary, still not sure on complete game idea, but the above bushes/scattering bugs seems reasonable
- Another idea came to mind of a spider in a web, waiting for bugs, and having to start timed events, such as when the spider bites, waiting for the venom to do its work, then spending time wrapping, when other bugs that may be stuck to the web could be trying to escape
- Definitely the spider in a web idea
- Letting the idea percolate in my head...
